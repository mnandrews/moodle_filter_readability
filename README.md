moodle_filter_readability
=========================
Built on top of the urltolink filter this filter uses the readibility API (freely avalible for non-commercial use) to grab page title, image and description to display and attactive informative link.
Please note this is an early release that does work on 2.6 but I doubt conforms to the moodle coding guidelines.

Wish list:
- When clicking link to load up a 'readibiltiy formatted' version of the web page within a pop-up/lighbox

If this looks interesting please fork and further develop, i'm reaching my limit of php knowledge. - Thanks!
